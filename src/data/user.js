	about: {
		title: "I’m Joey, and here is my story!",
		description:
			"Born and raised in the heart of Canada’s technology hub, Waterloo, I have been immersed in the world of tech from an early age. My curiosity was piqued not just by the computers and gadgets that surrounded me but by the complex problems they could solve. This early fascination naturally led me to pursue a degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, a decision that has deepened my interests in the field of technology as a whole. During my time at university, I've honed my expertise in software engineering, machine learning, and data analysis. This proficiency isn't just theoretical—it's been tested and expanded through a diverse array of hands-on projects. These projects include designing an autonomous drink delivery robot, engineering a fully-electric F1 car, and creating algorithms that optimize the mechanical components in a robotic manipulator. But life isn’t all work and no play! When I'm not behind the computer screen or buried in research papers, you'll find me in the garage working on car builds or at the racetrack pushing the limits of automotive performance. Cars are more than just a mode of transportation for me; they are a passion, an art form, and an extension of my analytical mindset.",
